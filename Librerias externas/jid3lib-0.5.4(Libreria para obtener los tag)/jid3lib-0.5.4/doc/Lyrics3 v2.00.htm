            <TD>
                <P>The Lyrics3 v2.00 tag is more complicated than the previous Lyrics3 tag
                    but has a lot more capabilities. Just like the old Lyrics3 tag it resides
                    between the audio and the ID3 tag, which must be present. The tag uses
                    only text for everything from content to size descriptors, which are
                    represented as numerical strings. This makes it easier to implement a
                    Lyrics3 v2.00 reader. At least if BASIC is your language of choice.</P>

                <P>The Lyrics3 block, after the MP3 audio and before the ID3 tag, begins
                    with the word "LYRICSBEGIN" after which a number of field records follows.
                    The Lyrics3 block ends with a six character size descriptor and the string
                    "LYRICS200". The size value includes the "LYRICSBEGIN" and "LYRICS200"
                    strings.</P>

                <P>Lyrics2 v2.00 uses somthing called fields to represent information. The
                    data in a field can consist of ASCII characters in the range 01 to 254
                    according to the standard. As the ASCII character map is only defined from
                    00 to 128 ISO-8859-1 might be assumed. Numerical fields are 5 or 6
                    characters long, depending on location, and are padded with zeroes.

                <P>Only the size of the tag sets the limit for how many fields may be
                    present. All fields uses a simple structure that includes a three
                    character field ID, six characters describing the size of the information
                    and the actual information. This makes it possible to read unknown fields
                    and write them back when saving the tag. There are no required fields in
                    the tag, but at least one field must exist. Fields can appear in any order
                    in the tag, except the indication field which must be the first field if
                    used. Fields that include more then one line uses [CR][LF] delimiters
                    between lines.</P></TD>

                                if timestamp is used, and there is no description, two delimiters
                                ("||||") should be used between the filename and the timestamp.

                                        still be correct)

                                        different path or drive. This will not work if the image is moved
                                        or drive letters has changed, and so should be avoided if possible
                                        (i.e. c:\images\artist.jpg)</LI></UL><B>Description</B> can be up to

                <P>The extended Album, Artist and Track are an extension to the fields in
