    <table border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="t">
        <p>ID3v2 is a new tagging system that lets you put enriching and
            relevant information about your audio files within them. In more down
            to earth terms, ID3v2 is a chunk of data prepended to the binary audio
            data. Each ID3v2 tag holds one or more smaller chunks of information,
            called frames. These frames can contain any kind of information and
            data you could think of such as title, album, performer, website,
            lyrics, equalizer presets, pictures etc. The block scheme to the right
            is an example of how the layout of a typical ID3v2 tagged audio file
            may look like.</p>

        <p>One of the design goals were that the ID3v2 should be very flexible
            and expandable. It is very easy to add new functions to the ID3v2 tag,
            because, just like in HTML, all parsers will ignore any information
            they don't recognize. Since each frame can be 16MB and the entire tag
            can be 256MB you'll probably never again be in the same situation as
            when you tried to write a useful comment in the old ID3 being limited
            to 30 characters.</p>

        <p>Speaking of characters, the ID3v2 supports Unicode so even if you
            use the Bopomofo character set you'll be able to write in your native
            language. You can also include in which language you're writing so that
            one file might contain e.g. the same lyrics but in different languages.</p>

        <p>Even though the tag supports a lot of byte consuming capabilities
            like inline pictures and even the possibility to include any other
            file, ID3v2 still tries to use the bytes as efficient as possibly. If
            you convert an ID3v1 tag to an ID3v2 tag it is even likely that the new
            tag will be smaller. If you convert an ID3v1 tag where all fields are
            full (that is, all 30 characters are used in every field) to an ID3v2
            tag it will be 56 bytes bigger. This is the worst case scenario for
            ID3v1 to ID3v2 conversion.</p>

        <p>Since it's so easy to implement new functionality into ID3v2, one
            can hope that we'll see a lot of creative uses for ID3v2 in the future.
            E.g. there is a built-in system for rating the music and counting how
            often you listen to a file, just to mention some brainstorm results
            that are included. This feature can be used to build playlists that
            play your favourite songs more often than others.</p>

    <table border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td class="t"><ul>
        <li>The ID3v2 tag is a container format, just like IFF or PNG files, allowing new frames (chunks) as evolution
            proceeds.</li>
        <li>Residing in the beginning of the audio file makes it suitable for streaming.</li>
        <li>Has an 'unsynchronization scheme' to prevent ID3v2-incompatible players to attempt to play the tag.</li>
        <li>Maximum tag size is 256 megabytes and maximum frame size is 16 megabytes.</li>
        <li>Byte conservative and with the capability to compress data it keeps the files small.</li>
        <li>The tag supports Unicode.</li>
        <li>Isn't entirely focused on musical audio, but also other types of audio.</li>
        <li>Has
            several new text fields such as composer, conductor, media type, BPM,
            copyright message, etc. and the possibility to design your own as you
            see fit.</li>
        <li>Can contain lyrics as well as music-synced lyrics (karaoke) in almost any language.</li>
        <li>Is able to contain volume, balance, equalizer and reverb settings.</li>
        <li>Could be linked to CD-databases such as <a href="http://www.cddb.com/">CDDB</a>.</li>
        <li>Is able to contain images and just about any file you want to include.</li>
        <li>Supports enciphered information, linked information and weblinks.</li>
