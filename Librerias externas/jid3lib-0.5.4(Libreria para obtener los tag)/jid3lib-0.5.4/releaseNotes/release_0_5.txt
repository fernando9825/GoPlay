jid3-lib

Release 0.5 8/9/2003

I've broken backwards compatibility. Frame Bodies no longer
require the boolean value is6ByteHeader to tell it if it is
apart of a ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, or ID3v2.4 frame. I pull this out
from the stack trace now.

I've added a copy constructor to all objects.

I've added tag conversion methods for all tag types. Before,
I only had converion to ID3v2.4, ID3v1.1, and Lyrics3v2. Now
you can convert to older versions of the tags.

I've fixed the conversion methods to create new tag objects.
Before, a converted tag would share some of the same object
pointers as its original tag.

The .zip and .tar.gz file now extract into a subdirectory.
(Pointed out to me, thanks)

I've changed the name of the .jar file to include the release
number. This seems to match what people are doing on apache.org.

I'm guessing there were numerous bug fixes, but I didn't keep
track of them individually. And thanks to those that emailed me
some fixes too.
